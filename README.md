# Accordion Demo Project (using Vite)

This repository contains a simple, small demo project built with Vite, showcasing the creation of components, the useState hook, passing data with props, and lifting data up in a React application. The project implements an accordion-style interface to display a list of questions with their respective answers. Only one question is displayed at a time, and the user can toggle the display of each question's answer.

## Overview

The Accordion demo project is designed to help frontend developers practice the concepts of React components, state management using the useState hook, and passing data with props. The application renders a list of questions, and each question can be toggled to display its associated answer.

## Demo

For a live demo of the Accordion project, please visit [Demo Page](https://accordion-demo-esmat.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Esmat/accordion-demo.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd accordion-demo
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

The Accordion demo project uses the following technologies:

- Vite
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (or CSS-in-JS, if applicable)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TAwJ3kWOqkw0o8UVtAMOHO/Accordion?node-id=0%3A1&t=1YEti8xBykw69tBH-1) - For design reference and inspiration

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

```
accordion-demo/


├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── SingleQuestion.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── data.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── ...
├── index.html
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── ...
```

- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components, including the `SingleQuestion` component.
  - `data.js`: Contains the array of question objects used by the application.
  - `App.js`: The main React component that renders the list of questions and manages the application state.
  - ... (other files)

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to use the Accordion component in your project:

1. Import the `SingleQuestion` component from `components/SingleQuestion.js`.

```javascript
import SingleQuestion from './components/SingleQuestion';
```

2. Review the `data.js` file and ensure that it contains an array of objects representing your questions and their associated data. Modify the data as needed for your use case.

3. Set up the `questions` array as a state variable using the `useState` hook in your main component (`App.js` or your preferred root component).

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import SingleQuestion from './components/SingleQuestion';
import questions from './data';

function App() {
  const [questionsState, setQuestionsState] = useState(questions);

  // Your other code here...

  return (
    <div>
      {questionsState.map((question, index) => (
        <SingleQuestion
          key={index}
          question={question}
          /* Any other props needed for SingleQuestion component */
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. In the `SingleQuestion` component, you can access the question text and answer from the `props.question` object and implement the toggle functionality using state and event handling.

5. Customize the styling of the components as needed to match your design and preferences.
